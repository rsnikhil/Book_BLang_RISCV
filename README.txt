This repository is the author's personal development area for the book:

    "Learn RISC-V CPU Implementation and BSV"
    Rishiyur S. Nikhil, 2024-2025

and its associated materials (code, exercises, slide decks, ...).
The "published" version is in another repo:

    https://github.com/rsnikhil/Learn_Bluespec_and_RISCV_Design

which is kept clean and uncluttered by the "book production" and "code
production" artefacts and tools that are in this repo, such as:

* LaTeX sources for book, slides, etc.
* SVG (InkScape) sources for figures in documents
* Source code with LaTeX meta-tags for excerpting into the book
* Python code to excerpt HDL code for inclusion in the book
* etc.
