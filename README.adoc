== Introduction

This is one of a pair of free and open-source repositories, addressing
two kinds of audience:

* Learn general principles of designing a RISC-V pipelined CPU (5+
  stages, mostly in-order).

** As a side-effect, learn digital design using the Bluespec BSV
   High-Level Hardware Design Language (HLHDL).

* Learn digital hardware design using the Bluespec BSV High-Level
  Hardware Design Language (HLHDL).

** As a side-effect, learn how to design a pipelined RISC-V CPU, which
   is used as a running example.

The two repositories are:

* Textbook: https://github.com/rsnikhil/Book_BLang_RISCV[]
* Source code for the two CPUs (Drum and Fife): https://github.com/bluespec/Fife[]

The latter repository includes a `Build_and_Run_Guide` document in the
`Doc/` directory that explains how to compile the Drum and Fife source
codes into Verilog using the free and open-source tools. The generated
Verilog can be run on Verilog simulators and on FPGAs.

== About RISC-V and BSV

RISC-V is an open-standard ISA (Instruction-Set Architecture).  ISA
specification documents can be found at
https://riscv.org/technical/specifications/[].  The site
https://riscv.org/[] also contains much additional useful material, in
particular information on GNU compilation/debugging tools gcc, gdb,
etc.

Bluespec BSV is a free, open-source HLHDL (High-Level Hardware Design
Language), a significant improvement in expressive power and
simplicity compared to Verilog/SystemVerilog/VHDL.  Its free,
open-source compiler is available at:
link:https://github.com/B-Lang-org/bsc[].  An appendix in the book
explores "Why BSV?" in more detail.

// ================================================================

== About our pedagogic approach

We construct two implementations of RISC-V, in this order:

* *Drum*, an "FSM" implementation, which almost looks like a software
  RISC-V simulator written in C, except that it is fully synthesizable
  and runs on FPGAs.

* *Fife*, a 5+ stage, mostly in-order, pipelined implementation,
  including simple branch prediction, scoreboarding, and speculative
  STOREs with a store-buffer.

The two implementations share _all_ the functional parts of RISC-V
code, which are covered in the first part of the book, with *Drum*.
By the time we reach the second part of the book, on *Fife*, we can
focus purely on pipelining questions, since RISC-V-specific semantics
have already been covered with *Drum*.

The book interleaves RISC-V topics and BSV topics in a mutually
reinforcing way, and describes the full design process.

The book and the two implementations focus on the "RV32I" subset of
the RISC-V Unprivileged ISA specification, plus a few features from
the Privileged specification to handle illegal instructions and other
traps, and interrupts.

// ================================================================

== Beyond this book and code

We are also preparing extensions to this BSV code to "complete" Drum
and Fife to make them Linux-capable:

* Add Unprivileged Spec features: RV32I and RV64I, extensions M
  (integer multiply/divide), A (atomics), F & D (single- and
  double-precision floating point), and C (compressed),

* Add Privileged Spec features: M, S, U privilige levels, Sv32 and
  Sv39 virtual memory schemes, etc.

* Add MMUs (with TLBs) and caches in the memory system.

* Add a CLINT (timers, timer interrupts, software interrupts)

* Add a PLIC (Platform-level Interrupt Controller)

A possible "Book 2" will cover these topics.  Please contact the
author for any news on that front.
