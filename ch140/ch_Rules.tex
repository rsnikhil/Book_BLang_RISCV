Rules are the fundamental dynamic behavior constructs in BSV.  A rule
is an infinite process.  Every rule consists of a \emph{condition} and
an \emph{action}: whenever the condition is true, the action is
performed; we say the rule ``fires'' whenever its condition is true.
A rule may not fire even if its condition is true, if it ``conflicts''
with another rule.

A rule may contain explicit and implicit conditions. 

Every method has an implicit conditions.  For a FIFO, the \emph{enq()}
method's implicit condition is false when the FIFO is full, {\ie} when
it does not contain space to enqueue a new item.  We also say the
method is ``enabled'' when its implicit condition is true.
